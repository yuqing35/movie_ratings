The audience’s evaluation of a movie is usually polarized. Professional film critics may evaluate a film from aspects such as picture composition and lens art. But for most of us, personal interest is the criterion for judging. We can notice that the rating of a movie is usually not proportional to the quality of the movie. Whether the genre of the movie or some other factor will determine a movie’s rating in advance? Or whether some factors affect the tolerance of the audience, resulting in the difference in ratings? For example, we guess that documentary movies may be easier to obtain a high rating. On the one hand, audiences would easily resonate with this type of film which is more related to their real life. On the other hand, audiences will be more tolerant of filmmaking, for example, they won’t expect to see flashy special effects in a documentary movie. In this project, we are interested in the factors that may influence the ratings of a film (e.g. release time, genre, movie duration). We’ll try to answer this question by analyzing related datasets. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic       We are interested in the factors that may influence the ratings of a film (e.g. release time, genre, movie duration).       We guess that if a movie is released during the holiday seasons (e.g., Thanksgiving, Christmas) then the ratings might be higher than those released at other times because people have an elevated mood and hence might tolerate the quality of the movie. Also, depending on the year the movie was released, the audience’s judging criteria would also vary. For old movies, technological lag makes people care more about storytelling. Now, people may judge from more aspects.       Considering genres, documentary movies may be easier to obtain a high rating. On the one hand, audiences would easily resonate with this type of film which is more related to their real life. On the other hand, audiences will be more tolerant of filmmaking, for example, they won’t expect to see flashy special effects in a documentary movie.       The movie duration may also influence the ratings. The longer the movie, the easier it is for people to lose their patience. For instance, in a dull movie with a longer running time, people might get bored or even doze off. The audience will question whether the film’s pace drags on too much for a long film. And a short movie usually can’t give a complete background. We wonder if there exists a reasonable duration for movies.       In addition, we can compare the ratings of movies produced in different regions or production companies. Considering all those factors, we are curious about that are there certain features that are important for a film to have high ratings. We’ll try to answer this question by analyzing related datasets. 2.2 Data availability IMDb Datasets Collected by IMDb organization through their users and their user-generated content. Copyright owned by IMDb. We believe IMDb is a reliable source for getting rating information. Each dataset is in a gzipped, tsv formatted file in the UTF-8 character set. They can be imported easily by ‘read_tsv’ in the ‘‘readr’ package, which can uncompress automatically for .gz format files. Also, we could import them by using the ggplot2movies package in R directly. The data is refreshed daily. We consider using this source because it contains up-to-date movie ratings collected directly from the users. In addition to movie ratings, it also provides information such as the title, length, region, language, release year, genres associated with the title, number of votes, etc. Then we’ll try to visualize the relationship between each factor and ratings. For example, we will compare movies with different genres (e.g., whether documentary movies would generally have higher ratings). MovieLens 25M Dataset These datasets were collected from MovieLens by GroupLens. GroupLens is a research lab in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. There were 162541 users selected, and users were selected at random. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies. There are 6 different datasets are generated, which contain over 25 million ratings across 62423 movies and their genres. We would mainly focus on movie.csv and rating.csv. We will combine the two tables by movies’ unique ID (using the “movieId” column). Because the variety and number of movies in this dataset are large, the results we got from this dataset would be more accurate and more convincing. And we could use this dataset to analyze the relationship between genres and ratings. These datasets are ‘CSV’ files, which can be imported easily by ‘read_csv’ in the ‘‘readr’ package. These data were created by 162541 users between January 09, 1995 and November 21, 2019. Thus this dataset was last updated and generated on November 21, 2019. If we have questions about the dataset, we can contact the team through the website by sending a contact request.

From the scatter plot, we can observe that there’s a positive correlation between movie length and rating Movies with length around 50 to 75 minutes have ratings all over the place Movies with length longer than 125 minutes have higher ratings in general Movies with exceptionally high ratings (&gt; 8) have all kinds of length Same conclusion can be drawn if we facet by movie genre There seems to be a positive relationship between movie length and ratings (especially for “Action”, “Comedy”, “Drama”) Documentary and Animation does not show positive correlation 4.2 Relationship between movie release time and rating We start by plotting the following frequency histograms to see the distribution of the data, we observe that The distribution of movies by year is left-skewed (most of the movies in the dataset is released after 1990) To inspect the relationship between ratings and release year, we decide to first round year into decade (e.g., 1990s means any year from 1990 to 1999), we can observe from the boxplot that movies released earlier than 1950s seems to have higher median rating than more recent movies. But recent movies have larger spread than earlier movies with respect to reatings. Same conclusion can be drawn from the ridgeline plot. 4.3 Relationship between movie genre and rating To reduce the impact of other factor, we mainly focus on the standard movies that have length between 90 to 120 minutes and were released between 2000 and 2010. We order the genres in decreasing order of high rating (above 8.5 points) percentage from top to bottom. We can observe that over 10 percent Documentary movies obtained ratings above 8.5 out of 10, which is a high proportion comparing to other genres. Also, it is obvious that only a small percentage of Documentary movies obtained low rating (below 5 points). By contrast, nearly 40% of Action Movies get low ratings(below 5 points), and they had lowest percentage on high ratings. To know that the ratings and the movie genres are not independent, we can have a Chi-squared test on the data. The null hypothesis: The ratings and the movie genres are not independent, which means there is no relationship between them. The Chi-squared test gives a really small p-value, so it is almost impossible to obtain the data given the null hypothesis is true. Thus, we’d like to reject the null hypothesis and say that the ratings and the movie genres are correlated. ## ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: df_percent_ma ## X-squared = 761.63, df = 20, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 Now, we can plot bar charts by decades, and we can observe similar patterns as above. The documentary movies always have relatively higher ratings, and the actions movies always have relatively worse performance on ratings. These findings are consistent with our expectations. We guessed that documentary movies may be easier to obtain a high rating, because audiences would easily resonate with this type of film which is more related to their real life, and audiences will be more tolerant of the visuals of documentary movies. However, many action movies are commercial films, which always have similar plot and mode. Thus the audience may be more likely to get bored and have higher requirements for special effects to give a high rating. Finally, without consider release year and length, the same conclusion can be drawn from the boxplots of all data.
