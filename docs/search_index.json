The audience’s evaluation of a movie is usually polarized. Professional film critics may evaluate a film from aspects such as picture composition and lens art. But for most of us, personal interest is the criterion for judging. We can notice that the rating of a movie is usually not proportional to the quality of the movie. Whether the genre of the movie or some other factor will determine a movie’s rating in advance? Or whether some factors affect the tolerance of the audience, resulting in the difference in ratings? For example, we guess that documentary movies may be easier to obtain a high rating. On the one hand, audiences would easily resonate with this type of film which is more related to their real life. On the other hand, audiences will be more tolerant of filmmaking, for example, they won’t expect to see flashy special effects in a documentary movie. In this project, we are interested in the factors that may influence the ratings of a film (e.g. release time, genre, movie duration). We’ll try to answer this question by analyzing related datasets. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic       We are interested in the factors that may influence the ratings of a film (e.g. release time, genre, movie duration).       We guess that if a movie is released during the holiday seasons (e.g., Thanksgiving, Christmas) then the ratings might be higher than those released at other times because people have an elevated mood and hence might tolerate the quality of the movie. Also, depending on the year the movie was released, the audience’s judging criteria would also vary. For old movies, technological lag makes people care more about storytelling. Now, people may judge from more aspects.       Considering genres, documentary movies may be easier to obtain a high rating. On the one hand, audiences would easily resonate with this type of film which is more related to their real life. On the other hand, audiences will be more tolerant of filmmaking, for example, they won’t expect to see flashy special effects in a documentary movie.       The movie duration may also influence the ratings. The longer the movie, the easier it is for people to lose their patience. For instance, in a dull movie with a longer running time, people might get bored or even doze off. The audience will question whether the film’s pace drags on too much for a long film. And a short movie usually can’t give a complete background. We wonder if there exists a reasonable duration for movies.       In addition, we can compare the ratings of movies produced in different regions or production companies. Considering all those factors, we are curious about that are there certain features that are important for a film to have high ratings. We’ll try to answer this question by analyzing related datasets. 2.2 Data availability IMDb Datasets Collected by IMDb organization through their users and their user-generated content. Copyright owned by IMDb. We believe IMDb is a reliable source for getting rating information. Each dataset is in a gzipped, tsv formatted file in the UTF-8 character set. They can be imported easily by ‘read_tsv’ in the ‘‘readr’ package, which can uncompress automatically for .gz format files. Also, we could import them by using the ggplot2movies package in R directly. The data is refreshed daily. We consider using this source because it contains up-to-date movie ratings collected directly from the users. In addition to movie ratings, it also provides information such as the title, length, region, language, release year, genres associated with the title, number of votes, etc. Then we’ll try to visualize the relationship between each factor and ratings. For example, we will compare movies with different genres (e.g., whether documentary movies would generally have higher ratings). MovieLens 25M Dataset These datasets were collected from MovieLens by GroupLens. GroupLens is a research lab in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. There were 162541 users selected, and users were selected at random. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies. There are 6 different datasets are generated, which contain over 25 million ratings across 62423 movies and their genres. We would mainly focus on movie.csv and rating.csv. We will combine the two tables by movies’ unique ID (using the “movieId” column). Because the variety and number of movies in this dataset are large, the results we got from this dataset would be more accurate and more convincing. And we could use this dataset to analyze the relationship between genres and ratings. These datasets are ‘CSV’ files, which can be imported easily by ‘read_csv’ in the ‘‘readr’ package. These data were created by 162541 users between January 09, 1995 and November 21, 2019. Thus this dataset was last updated and generated on November 21, 2019. If we have questions about the dataset, we can contact the team through the website by sending a contact request.

Copyright owned by IMDb. We believe IMDb is a reliable source for getting rating information.       We consider using this source because it is one of the biggest movie database on the web and is collected directly from the users. In addition to movie ratings, it also provides information such as the title, length, release year, genres associated with the title, number of votes, etc.       We choose to import this data by using the ggplot2movies package in R directly since it is the easiest way. The data is published on 2015-08-25 and the maintainer is Hadley Wickham. The dataset contains 58,788 rows and 24 columns. Each column is either character type or numeric/integer type. Movie genres (“Action”, “Animation”, “Comedy”, “Drama”, “Documentary”, “Romance”, “Short”) are one-hot encoded and there exists movies with more than one genres. MovieLens 25M Dataset       These datasets were collected from MovieLens by GroupLens.

We import the datasets by ‘read_csv’ in the ‘readr’ package and combine the two tables by movies’ unique ID (using the “movieId” column).       There are 25000095 rows and 4 columns in rating.csv and all the columns are numeric/integer type. Each row represents one rating of a movie rated by one user. There are 62423 rows and 3 columns in movies.csv and the columns are either character or numeric/integer type. One movie can have multiple genres, and each genre name is separated by “|” coded in one column. And we first need to separate these genres into different columns. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation       Two data sets are used in this project, we will discuss them separately. 3.2.1 IMDb Datasets       Take a look of the original data which is messy. ## # A tibble: 6 × 24 ## title year length budget rating votes r1 r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 r7 r8 r9 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 $ 1971 121 NA 6.4 348 4.5 4.5 4.5 4.5 14.5 24.5 24.5 14.5 4.5 ## 2 $1000 a… 1939 71 NA 6 20 0 14.5 4.5 24.5 14.5 14.5 14.5 4.5 4.5 ## 3 $21 a D… 1941 7 NA 8.2 5 0 0 0 0 0 24.5 0 44.5 24.5 ## 4 $40,000 1996 70 NA 8.2 6 14.5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 34.5 ## 5 $50,000… 1975 71 NA 3.4 17 24.5 4.5 0 14.5 14.5 4.5 0 0 0 ## 6 $pent 2000 91 NA 4.3 45 4.5 4.5 4.5 14.5 14.5 14.5 4.5 4.5 14.5 ## # … with 9 more variables: r10 &lt;dbl&gt;, mpaa &lt;chr&gt;, Action &lt;int&gt;, Animation &lt;int&gt;, Comedy &lt;int&gt;, ## # Drama &lt;int&gt;, Documentary &lt;int&gt;, Romance &lt;int&gt;, Short &lt;int&gt;       In this data set, each genre type of movies is set to a variable. However, they are not different variables, they should be values of a common variable “genres”. Thus, we use pivot_longer to transform the data. (We only display columns that shows the transformation here.) ## # A tibble: 6 × 3 ## title rating genres ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 $ 6.4 Comedy ## 2 $ 6.4 Drama ## 3 $1000 a Touchdown 6 Comedy ## 4 $21 a Day Once a Month 8.2 Animation ## 5 $40,000 8.2 Comedy ## 6 $pent 4.3 Drama       The columns r1-10 give percentile of users who rated this movie a 1. Since we are exploring the impact of personal interests on movies’ rating, we don’t mind extreme or biased ratings. So we will ignore these variables.       Also, we believe that the movies rated by less than 200 IMDB users are unrepresentative, so we use filter() on the column “votes” to remove those movies. 3.2.2 MovieLens 25M Dataset       We would mainly focus on the files movie.csv and rating.csv. There are 25 million rows and 4 columns in rating.csv, each row represents one rating of a movie rated by one user. There are 62423 rows and 3 columns in movies.csv, one movie can have multiple genres, and each genre name is separated by “|” coded in one column.       Since the original data files are too large to upload and lead to overplotting, we decide to only process a random sample of them by using slice_sample().       The ratings and genres of a movie are in separate files, so we need first combine the two data sets by movies’ ID which is unique and consistent. For every movie, we obtain a lot of scores rated by different users, we choose to compute the average rating for each movie. ## X movieId title genres average_rating ## 1 1 175661 The Hitman&#39;s Bodyguard (2017) Action|Comedy 4.291667 ## 2 2 4020 Gift, The (2000) Thriller 3.250000 ## 3 3 2865 Sugar Town (1999) Comedy 3.000000 ## 4 4 73232 Girl in the Park, The (2007) Drama 4.000000 ## 5 5 2878 Hell Night (1981) Horror 2.300000 ## 6 6 2348 Sid and Nancy (1986) Drama 3.478261       As we can seen, one movie can have multiple genres, and each genre name is separated by “|” coded in one column. Since we are exploring the impact of genres on ratings, we separate those movies into different rows that each contains only one type of movie genres. Finally, we obtain the clean data that we’ll work with in the following parts. ## # A tibble: 6 × 5 ## X movieId title genres average_rating ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 175661 The Hitman&#39;s Bodyguard (2017) Action 4.29 ## 2 1 175661 The Hitman&#39;s Bodyguard (2017) Comedy 4.29 ## 3 2 4020 Gift, The (2000) Thriller 3.25 ## 4 3 2865 Sugar Town (1999) Comedy 3 ## 5 4 73232 Girl in the Park, The (2007) Drama 4 ## 6 5 2878 Hell Night (1981) Horror 2.3 3.3 Missing value analysis 3.3.1 IMDb Datasets       The columns/variables we used have no missing values. 3.3.2 MovieLens 25M Dataset       The columns/variables we used have no missing values. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Relationship between movie length and rating 4.2 Relationship between movie release time and rating 4.3 Relationship between movie genre and rating", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Relationship between movie length and rating We start by plotting the following frequency histogram to see the distribution of the data, we observe that We would expect that a standard movies have length around 90 to 120 minutes, but the plot shows a lot of outliers We decide to remove the those outliers (those outside fences). From the scatter plot, we can observe that there’s a positive correlation between movie length and rating Movies with length around 50 to 75 minutes have ratings all over the place Movies with length longer than 125 minutes have higher ratings in general Movies with exceptionally high ratings (&gt; 8) have all kinds of length Same conclusion can be drawn if we facet by movie genre There seems to be a positive relationship between movie length and ratings (especially for “Action”, “Comedy”, “Drama”) Documentary and Animation does not show positive correlation 4.2 Relationship between movie release time and rating We start by plotting the following frequency histograms to see the distribution of the data, we observe that The distribution of movies by year is left-skewed (most of the movies in the dataset is released after 1990) To inspect the relationship between ratings and release year, we decide to first round year into decade (e.g., 1990s means any year from 1990 to 1999), we can observe from the boxplot that movies released earlier than 1950s seems to have higher median rating than more recent movies. But recent movies have larger spread than earlier movies with respect to reatings. Same conclusion can be drawn from the ridgeline plot. 4.3 Relationship between movie genre and rating To reduce the impact of other factor, we mainly focus on the standard movies that have length between 90 to 120 minutes and were released between 2000 and 2010. We order the genres in decreasing order of high rating (above 8.5 points) percentage from top to bottom. We can observe that over 10 percent Documentary movies obtained ratings above 8.5 out of 10, which is a high proportion comparing to other genres. Also, it is obvious that only a small percentage of Documentary movies obtained low rating (below 5 points). By contrast, nearly 40% of Action Movies get low ratings(below 5 points), and they had lowest percentage on high ratings. To know that the ratings and the movie genres are not independent, we can have a Chi-squared test on the data. The null hypothesis: The ratings and the movie genres are not independent, which means there is no relationship between them. The Chi-squared test gives a really small p-value, so it is almost impossible to obtain the data given the null hypothesis is true. Thus, we’d like to reject the null hypothesis and say that the ratings and the movie genres are correlated. ## ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: df_percent_ma ## X-squared = 761.63, df = 20, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 Now, we can plot bar charts by decades, and we can observe similar patterns as above. The documentary movies always have relatively higher ratings, and the actions movies always have relatively worse performance on ratings. These findings are consistent with our expectations. We guessed that documentary movies may be easier to obtain a high rating, because audiences would easily resonate with this type of film which is more related to their real life, and audiences will be more tolerant of the visuals of documentary movies. However, many action movies are commercial films, which always have similar plot and mode. Thus the audience may be more likely to get bored and have higher requirements for special effects to give a high rating. Finally, without consider release year and length, the same conclusion can be drawn from the boxplots of all data.
